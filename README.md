# Confetti-Box ðŸŽ‰
A super simple file host. Inspired by [Catbox](https://catbox.moe) and [Uguu](https://uguu.se).

## Features
### Current
- Entirely self contained, tiny (~4MB) single binary 
- Customizable using a simple config file
- Only stores one copy of a given hash on the backend
- Chunked uploads of configurable size
- Fast (enough), runs just fine on a Raspberry Pi
- Simple API for interfacing with it programmatically
- No database setup required, uses self-contained in memory database
  serialized to a small, LZ4 compressed file.

### Planned
- Theming
- More mochi
